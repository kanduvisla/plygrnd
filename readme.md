## What is this?

**#plygrnd is a framework to make neato moving stuff with canvas.**

It's JavaScript only and relies on modern browsers with canvas support. It offers an
underlying engine with stuff that makes your animation run and small utilities to make
drawing with canvas somewhat easier, so you only have to worry about creating visual
eye-candy.
